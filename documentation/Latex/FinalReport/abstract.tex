The Injectable Medicines Guide is an Android application, which was created for the NHS Wales under the Software Alliance Wales Scheme. The Injectable Medicines Guide aims to aid NHS staff in administering injectable medicines to patients, by providing portable access to a dataset of drug monographs.

Drug information is downloaded from a database provided by the NHS, this data is then stored locally on the device, so that it can be used when no Internet connection is available. 

The downloaded data is then utilised by the application, allowing the user to search through the entire list of downloaded drugs.  Once the user has found the drug they were searching for, they can select it and will displayed with a detailed monograph of the selected drug. The monograph is displayed neatly to the user with helping information where needed. 

The Injectable Medicines Guide provides the user with a calculator for many of the drugs inside the database. The calculator can be used to calculate both dose and infusion rate values for a specific patient. When a calculation is performed the result of the calculation and a breakdown of the calculation is displayed to the user.
